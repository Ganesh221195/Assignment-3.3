1.)List the components of hadoop2.X and explain each component in detail


Hadoop 2.x has the following three Major Components

*HDFS
*YARN
*MapReduce

    HDFS -  The Java-based distributed file system that can store all kinds of data without prior organization.
             HDFS holds very large amount of data and provides easier access.
            To store such huge data, the files are stored across multiple machines.
            These files are stored in redundant fashion to rescue the system from possible data losses in case of failure.
            HDFS also makes applications available to parallel processing

    MapReduce - A software programming model for processing large sets of data in parallel.
                MapReduce is a processing technique and a program model for distributed computing based on java. 
                The MapReduce algorithm contains two important tasks, namely Map and Reduce.
                 Map takes a set of data and converts it into another set of data, where individual elements are broken down into tuples (key/value pairs).
                Secondly, reduce task, which takes the output from a map as an input and combines those data tuples into a smaller set of tuples.
                As the sequence of the name MapReduce implies, the reduce task is always performed after the map job

    YARN - A resource management framework for scheduling and handling resource requests from distributed applications.
           YARN is the prerequisite for Enterprise Hadoop, providing resource management and a central platform to deliver consistent operations,
            security, and data governance tools across Hadoop clusters.
           YARN also extends the power of Hadoop to incumbent and new technologies found within the data center so that they can take advantage of cost effective,
           linear-scale storage and processing
